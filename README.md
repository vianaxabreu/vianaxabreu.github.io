# 🧠 Data Portfolio – Data Engineering, Analysis & Science

Hi there! 👋🏾 Welcome.
In here I’m building and sharing my personal learning projects across **data engineering**, **data analysis**, and **data science**.

The page is still a work in progress, but soon it will include hands-on projects that reflect how I approach real-world data problems.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find (Soon)

- Clean, modular ETL pipelines  
- Interactive data visualizations and dashboards  
- Machine learning experiments and insights  
- Tools and workflows I use — like Python, SQL, Airflow, Git, and cloud platforms (GCP)

---

## ✅ Good Practices I Follow

As a data engineer and analyst, I focus on:

- Writing code that’s clear and maintainable  
- Building scalable, testable pipelines  
- Documenting my process and results  
- Keeping things version-controlled and reproducible  
- Making data useful — whether that’s through pipelines, analysis, or ML
